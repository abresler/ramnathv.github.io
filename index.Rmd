.lead I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management in the [Desautels Faculty of Management](http://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/) at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca). My research primarily focuses on the application of predictive analytics and optimization methodologies to improve operational decisions in retailing. I got my PhD in Operations Management from the [Wharton School](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), and worked at [McKinsey and Company](http://www.mckinsey.com/) prior to that.

.lead I am addicted to R and Javascript and have developed two R packages,  [rCharts](http://rcharts.io) and [Slidify](http://slidify.github.io), aimed at simplifying the process of creating interactive visualizations and web-friendly documents, straight from R. I am writing a book on Interactive Documents with R
