.lead I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management in the [Desautels Faculty of Management]() at [McGill University](). My research primarily focuses on the application of predictive analytics and optimization methodologies to improve operational decisions in retailing. I got my PhD in Operations Management from the [Wharton School](), and worked at [McKinsey and Company]() prior to that.

.lead I am addicted to R and Javascript and have developed two R packages,  [rCharts](http://rcharts.io) and [Slidify](http://slidify.github.io), aimed at simplifying the process of creating interactive visualizations and web-friendly documents, straight from R. I am writing a book on [Interactive Documents with R]().
